              Thanks for signing up to ProximaRide!<br><br>
              I'm David, a dad and the founder, and glad that you decided to join us.<br><br>
              
              I started ProximaRide because I wanted to make ridesharing safer, more affordable and more reliable for people like my daughter, who travels to her school in Toronto (from Montreal) every week. Everyone should arrive at their destination safely, just like her!<br><br>
              
              Don't worry, we don't send a lot of emails; just the essentials. So, just relax and enjoy the ride!<br><br>
              We are always here to answer any queries that you may have so feel free to contact us!<br><br>
              And remember - sharing is caring!<br><br>
